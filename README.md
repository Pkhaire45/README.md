🚀 I'm a **Full-Stack Developer** blending code with creativity to build scalable APIs, dynamic UIs, and AI-powered systems.

At **TechTech (Powered by Prance)**, I engineer production-ready web apps using **Node.js**, **Express**, **MySQL**, and **React.js** — while diving deep into **Generative AI**, **LLMs**, and chatbot logic to automate user interactions and supercharge digital products.

💼 Previously at **Infinite Graphix Technologies**, I built exam and HR platforms using **React**, **Spring Boot**, and **Java**, and leveled up my dev skills in a real-world, fast-paced team environment.
